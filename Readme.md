# Elm App

This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).

# Website

         This website was built on Elm (frontend platform) and APIs are built in .NET/C# to serve data.

# Purpose
 
         Truck Sales team needed a super fast search/fitler trucks on inventory.

# Why Elm and .NET

         **Frontend**: Elm, I honeslty believe this is the best open-source/front-end tech out there in the market, looked at React.js, Angular and Vue, none could gave the confidence that Elm gave me, so there is not much to make a decision on what to choose for frontend other than Elm, simply because of its super smart compiler with 100% type-safty, immutability.
         
         Bachend: .NET/C#, this is what my primary skillset is, so there is not other thought on this side, simple.
